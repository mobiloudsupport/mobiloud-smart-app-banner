== Description ==

We created this plugin so that you can use Smart App Banners on your WordPress site to boost downloads for your iOS and Android app. Smart app banners are only visible when users are browsing your site from a mobile device, so exactly at the best time for them to discover and download your app.

Mobile apps generally provide a better user experience to users and allow you to send push notifications, meaning you’re always better off getting a web visitor to download your app, for a chance they’ll come back again and again and become a loyal user. App publishers regularly see much higher return rates, time spent and pages per session in their mobile apps vs their mobile sites.

Smart App Banners are a great way to get more website visitors to download your app. According to Apple:

“Smart App Banners vastly improve users’ browsing experience compared to other promotional methods. Users will trust that tapping the banner will take them to the App Store and not a third-party advertisement. They will appreciate that banners are presented unobtrusively at the top of a webpage, instead of as a full-screen ad interrupting the web content”

Smart App Banners provide an easy and familiar way to promote apps to users accessing your site through mobile Safari and Android browsers. They are presented as a banner at the top of web pages that show:

- Details about the app
- The app icon

On iOS, the CTA button will change from ‘view’ to ‘open’ depending on whether the user already has the app downloaded on their phone. If the user doesn’t have the app downloaded on their device already, clicking the button will take them right through to the app download page on App Store.
